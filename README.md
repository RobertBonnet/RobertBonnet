## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Robert, a data scientist with over 5 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a Ph.D. in Pharmacology. I’ve published widely-read scientific articles in health sciences (30,000+ reads in 10+ countries 🌎) and am now diving deep into data science, machine learning, and applied analytics to drive decision-making in R&D.

Currently completing a **Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen** (2024–2025), where I’ve built predictive models in mining and energy sectors and applied machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
