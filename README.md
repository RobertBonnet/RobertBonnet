## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Robert, a data scientist with over 5 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a Ph.D. in Pharmacology. I’ve published widely-read scientific articles in health sciences (30,000+ reads in 10+ countries 🌎) and am now diving deep into data science, machine learning, and applied analytics to drive decision-making in R&D.

Currently completing a **Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen** (2024–2025), where I’ve built predictive models in mining and energy sectors and applied machine learning techniques to real-world problems.

Uncover drivers of supplement sales to optimize marketing and product strategy and improve forecasting.
• Performed exploratory analysis and KPI tracking on historical supplement sales to identify trends, seasonality, and performance.
• Addressed business questions by segmenting top SKUs, evaluating customer purchasing patterns, and uncovering revenue drivers.
• Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing, visualization, and insights generation to support data-driven decisions.

### 📞 [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project] (https://github.com/RobertBonnet/Interconnect---Customer-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/Interconnect%20-%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Project.ipynb)
Predict contract cancellations to reduce customer churn in the telecom industry.
• Built a binary classification model to predict whether a customer would cancel their contract based on service, payment, and demographic data.
• Addressed the business need to reduce churn by identifying high-risk customers and enabling proactive retention strategies.
• Utilized Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC.

### 💊 [Drug-Induced Autoimmunity Prediction] (https://www.loom.com/share/b0c63451d4154d86b5dd60017c812501)
Identify compounds likely to trigger drug-induced autoimmune responses.
• Built a binary classification model to predict the likelihood of a compound causing autoimmunity based on molecular descriptors.
• Addressed a real-world pharmacovigilance problem by improving early identification of immunotoxic drug candidates.
• Employed Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, cross-validation, and evaluation with ROC-AUC and precision-recall metrics.

### 🧬 [Breast Cancer Diagnostic] (https://www.loom.com/share/8e3c20e967004b4cbbebbe5229619598)
Predict breast cancer diagnosis based on biopsy measurements.
• Developed a classification model to predict whether tumors are malignant or benign using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
• Solved the problem of early detection and accurate diagnosis by analyzing features such as cell size, texture, and concavity.
• Used Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn for data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and result visualization.
